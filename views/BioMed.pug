        h2 Information About Major 
        p With an emphasis on generating new ideas to combat a variety of health problems people face, Biomedical Engineering is a major that works on developing the technology required for living and medical systems. The work of biomedical engineers typically involves researching and creating advancements in health care to either help solve an issue or improve the way a problem is currently being dealt with. With areas such as biomechanics, biomaterials, cellular engineering, and more, Biomedical Engineering has a close relationship to other healthcare professions such as physicians, nurses, and therapists with a common goal of overall improving the way people are cared for when they need medical assistance.
        h2 TAMU Info 
        p At Texas A&M, biomedical engineering students are involved in the development and application of engineering science and technology for living and medical systems. This degree is designed to prepare students for team involvement with other engineers, physicians, and life scientists to solve a wide array of biological and medical problems. They also take a number of elective courses that accommodate studentâ€™s special interests in the fields of biomechanics, biomaterials, biomolecular and cellular engineering, and bioinstrumentation. Also, students who are interested in pursuing medical school are able to meet admission prerequisites through slight modifications and additions to the curriculum. Biomedical engineering takes 128 credit hours to complete.
