    h2 Information About Major 
    p Architectural engineering uses engineering principles and technology to building design and construction. They work together with architects and civil engineers but they are unique in their roles and skills when incorporated in a building design team. They are different than architects as architects specialize in spatial, functional, and aesthetic design while architectural engineers use engineering to construct systems within a building. They use many different types of math and sciences like physics, materials science, and calculus to design and ensure that these buildings are functional and safe to be constructed.
    h2 TAMU Info 
    p At Texas A&M, there are two main tracks that a student can take: the structural systems for buildings, and mechanical systems for buildings tracks. The Structural Building Systems track allows for students to have more emphasis on structural design and the safety of buildings. The Mechanical Systems track allows for students to have more emphasis on energy efficiency, HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning), building environment, and building environmental controls. Both tracks are highly similar in the sense that they prepare students for careers within the architectural, engineering and construction industries, but deviate only on these emphasis areas. Architectural engineering takes 128 credit hours to complete.
