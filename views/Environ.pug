    h2 Information About Major 
    p  Environmental engineers utilize soil science, biology, engineering, and chemistry principles to develop solutions for environmental problems. They generally work to solve or improve waste disposal, recycling, water and air pollution control, and public health issues. This type of engineering has a large amount of history, dating back to the beginning of the cultivation of land by humans. They also work to find the effects of technological advancements on the environment, especially in addressing major environmental issues like acid rain, ozone depletion, global warming, water pollution, and air pollution from automobile and other industrial sources. Environmental engineering also is known to have close ties with civil and chemical engineering.
