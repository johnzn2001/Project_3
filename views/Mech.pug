    h2 Information About Major 
    p Mechanical engineering is by far the most popular and versatile engineering degree. Mechanical engineers are able to design, develop, build, and test anything that moves from components to even the human body. They combine physics and mathematics along with principles from materials science to work with mechanical systems. This engineering is one of the oldest and broadest engineering branches, dating back to the industrial revolution in Europe in the 18th century. The forefront of the industry pursues developments in composites, mechatronics, and nanotechnology. It overlaps heavily with aerospace, metallurgical, civil, electrical, manufacturing, chemical, and industrial engineering. 
    h2 TAMU Info 
    p At Texas A&M, those who are pursuing the mechanical engineering degree will have students develop and apply logical thinking, innovative approaches, and ethical standards as a prerequisite for professional competence. The curriculum consists of basic theory courses that are complemented with laboratory experiences in dynamic systems and controls, design, experimentation, fluid mechanics, heat transfer, manufacturing, and materials. Mechanical engineering requires a total of 128 credit hours to complete.
